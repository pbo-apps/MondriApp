# MondriApp
Lab project from week 5 of Adam Porter's Coursera course, Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1
https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-programming/home/welcome

Lab objectives:
Create an application from scratch with an interesting user interface using what you learned in the User Interface Classes
Lesson.
This application's user interface is composed of geometric shapes arranged in a particular order. Its layout is inspired 
by the works of De Stijl artists such as Piet Mondrian and Ben Nicholson.
